# Spotify-Hotkey
A simple Auto-Hotkey script for global volume control keys for Spotify.


This script requires AutoHotKey to be installed on the machine.
For a quick & easy get started guide on how to use AutoHotKey see: https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm

To use this script with custom keys:
  1. Copy Template into a new text file.
  2. Choose your two custom keys from the keylist.
  3. Replace "KeyFromKeyListAbove" with your two different keys.
  4. Save the file as a .ahk
  5. All done, now run the file with Spotify maximised in the background (As in do not minimise Spotify but rather maximise another window on top).
 
To use this script with default keys:
 1. Copy Example into a new text file.
 2. Save the file as a .ahk
 3. All done, now run the file with Spotify maximised in the background (As in do not minimise Spotify but rather maximise another window on top).
